# Project Title

Honest-Buildings is a web app built for NYC renters to rate and review their buildings and respective building managers. Think of it like a yelp for rental buildings in the city and as a way to bring some transparency to renters in the city with ever rising rent prices.

## User Story

As a user, I can (upon signing up/logging in):
* Search for a building in the greater NYC area by entering a street address or neighborhood

* Write a review for a particular building that I may have lived in and leave ratings for the building's cleanliness, general upkeep, and its management's quality and speed at resolving issues.

* View a building management's profile, which includes contact info on the management company, application fee, list of all buildings under its management (along with a map view of its buildings), and its cumulative average rating.

## How to use
Please visit [the deployed site](https://honest-buildings.herokuapp.com/) and sign up!
